## 🧠 Project Summary

### 📘 Project 1 — Introductory NLP Techniques

**Overview:**  
This project introduces foundational NLP concepts and workflows.  
**Typical tasks you’ll see here:**

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, normalization)
- Basic feature extraction (e.g., bag-of-words, TF-IDF)
- Simple classification or analysis tasks

---

### 🧪 Project 2 — Applied NLP Models

**Overview:**  
Builds on Project 1 with more advanced models and evaluation.  
**Typical tasks you’ll see here:**

- Training and validating NLP models on real datasets
- Using libraries like scikit-learn, spaCy, or neural models
- Evaluating performance with metrics and error analysis
